    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is designed as an interactive digital museum. The structure guides the user from a high-level gallery of all cameras to a detailed "exhibit" view for each one. The core is a filterable grid, allowing users to curate the collection by era, type, or chapter, making the large dataset manageable. This is supplemented by a "Data Insights" section with interactive charts for quantitative comparison. This structure was chosen to empower user-led discovery, allowing them to either browse freely or analyze specific trends, offering a more engaging experience than a linear report. -->

This specific camera, serial number 105, was the personal camera of its visionary designer, Oskar Barnack, making it one of the most significant photographic artifacts in existence.", analysis: "The collectibility of this camera rests on the absolute pillars of innovation and provenance. Barnack's design choice for the 36x24mm negative size established the 'full-frame' format. The astronomical difference in value between this unit and other 0-Series models is due to its direct, documented connection to the inventor." },
            { rank: 2, model: "Kodak DCS 100", type: "Digital SLR (Nikon F3 Body)", era: "Digital Revolution (1991)", originalPrice: 20000, currentValue: 10000, synopsis: "The Kodak DCS 100 marks the birth of the commercial DSLR. Built upon the chassis of a Nikon F3 film camera, it was a cumbersome, two-piece beast aimed at photojournalists.", analysis: "Collectible for its absolute historical primacy. It physically bridged the analog and digital worlds, mating a professional film body to a 1.3-megapixel digital sensor and a separate storage unit. With only 987 units sold, it is exceptionally rare." },
            { rank: 3, model: "Leica M3", type: "35mm Film Rangefinder", era: "Mid-Century Classic (1954)", originalPrice: 500, currentValue: 1650, synopsis: "The Leica M3 is the camera that perfected the 35mm rangefinder and defined the brand's modern identity. It was the benchmark for photojournalism and street photography for decades.", analysis: "Rooted in its groundbreaking innovation and sublime design. It introduced the M-bayonet mount, a combined rangefinder/viewfinder, and automatically switching, parallax-corrected frame lines. Its all-mechanical, buttery-smooth operation offers a purely tactile experience." },
            { rank: 4, model: "Hasselblad 500C/M", type: "Medium Format Film SLR", era: "Mid-Century Classic (1957)", originalPrice: 600, currentValue: 2500, synopsis: "The undisputed icon of professional medium format photography. Its revolutionary modular system and partnership with Carl Zeiss optics made it the workhorse for top photographers and NASA.", analysis: "Appeal is multifaceted. Its core innovation was its modularity—swapping lenses, film magazines, and viewfinders. The leaf shutter in the lens enabled flash sync at any speed, a critical advantage for studio work. Its cultural resonance is immense." },
            { rank: 5, model: "Nikon F", type: "35mm Film SLR", era: "Mid-Century Classic (1959)", originalPrice: 233, currentValue: 425, synopsis: "The camera that shattered the German monopoly on professional photography and established Japan as the new industry leader. It became the definitive workhorse for photojournalists.", analysis: "Stems from its revolutionary impact and bulletproof reputation. It was the first 35mm SLR to offer a complete professional system from day one, including a vast range of lenses and interchangeable viewfinders. Its reputation for being nearly indestructible made it the trusted tool in demanding environments." },
            { rank: 6, model: "Rolleiflex 2.8F", type: "Medium Format Film TLR", era: "Mid-Century Classic (1960)", originalPrice: 400, currentValue: 2550, synopsis: "Represents the zenith of the twin-lens reflex (TLR) camera design. Beloved for its unique top-down shooting posture, whisper-quiet shutter, and extraordinary image quality.", analysis: "Appeal is tied to its unique design and superlative performance. The act of looking down into the waist-level finder creates a more contemplative connection with the subject. The 2.8F model is the most refined, featuring legendary Carl Zeiss Planar or Schneider-Kreuznach Xenotar lenses." },
            { rank: 7, model: "Canon F-1", type: "35mm Film SLR", era: "Mid-Century Classic (1971)", originalPrice: 220, currentValue: 325, synopsis: "Canon's monumental answer to the dominant Nikon F. A top-of-the-line professional system SLR designed to be brutally tough, mechanically precise, and endlessly versatile.", analysis: "Collectible as both a historical landmark and a robust tool. It was Canon's first truly successful professional SLR system, built around the new FD mount. Engineered to extreme standards of durability, guaranteeing 100,000 shutter cycles." },
            { rank: 8, model: "Leica M6", type: "35mm Film Rangefinder", era: "Modern Film (1984)", originalPrice: 2500, currentValue: 3500, synopsis: "The perfect fusion of classic mechanical purity and modern convenience. It took the revered form factor of the M3 and integrated a highly accurate TTL light meter.", analysis: "Its collectibility lies in its perfect balance. It retains the all-mechanical operation that purists cherish, while the built-in meter streamlines the shooting process. For many, the M6 is the quintessential modern film Leica." },
            { rank: 9, model: "Mamiya 7II", type: "Medium Format Film Rangefinder", era: "Modern Film (1999)", originalPrice: 2000, currentValue: 4750, synopsis: "Hailed as the ultimate medium format travel camera, it delivers breathtaking 6x7cm image quality from a shockingly lightweight, compact, and quiet body.", analysis: "Prized for offering the best of two worlds: immense detail with the portability of a 35mm rangefinder. Its lenses are legendary for their optical perfection. The lack of a true digital successor ensures it holds its value exceptionally well." },
            { rank: 10, model: "Contax T2", type: "35mm Film Point & Shoot", era: "Modern Film (1990)", originalPrice: 800, currentValue: 1350, synopsis: "The king of the 1990s premium point-and-shoot craze. Housed in a titanium body with a razor-sharp Carl Zeiss Sonnar lens, its popularity exploded after being adopted by celebrities.", analysis: "A case study in how cultural resonance can redefine value. Its modern collectibility was driven by its appearance in the hands of figures like Kendall Jenner and Frank Ocean. Beyond the hype, it is a superbly engineered camera." },
            { rank: 11, model: "Pentax K1000", type: "35mm Film SLR", era: "Modern Film (1976)", originalPrice: 300, currentValue: 225, synopsis: "The quintessential student camera. For over two decades, its simple, all-manual, and incredibly durable design made it the default choice for photography courses worldwide.", analysis: "Rooted in its cultural significance and functional purity. Its fully mechanical shutter can operate without a battery. This reliability and its reputation as the perfect tool for learning continue to drive strong demand." },
            { rank: 12, model: "Olympus OM-1", type: "35mm Film SLR", era: "Mid-Century Classic (1972)", originalPrice: 250, currentValue: 160, synopsis: "The camera that ignited the compact SLR revolution. Conceived by designer Yoshihisa Maitani, the OM-1 was shockingly small and light compared to its contemporaries, yet sacrificed nothing in professional features.", analysis: "Collectible for its landmark design. Its most lauded feature is its enormous, bright viewfinder, which puts even many modern DSLRs to shame. Its design DNA influenced the entire industry for decades." },
            { rank: 13, model: "Yashica T4 Super D", type: "35mm Film Point & Shoot", era: "Modern Film (1992)", originalPrice: 300, currentValue: 675, synopsis: "The 'other' legendary premium point-and-shoot. It boasts a world-class Carl Zeiss Tessar 35mm f/3.5 T* lens capable of producing incredibly sharp images from an unassuming plastic body.", analysis: "Value is almost entirely derived from the performance of its lens. Its value has been significantly inflated by social media hype. The 'Super D' model adds a top-mounted 'Super Scope' viewfinder for candid street photography." },
            { rank: 14, model: "Apple QuickTake 100", type: "Early Consumer Digital", era: "Digital Revolution (1994)", originalPrice: 749, currentValue: 200, synopsis: "One of the first consumer-level color digital cameras. Co-developed with Kodak, its importance as an early, innovative Apple product with a unique design makes it highly collectible.", analysis: "Appeal lies in its innovation and provenance. It was the first mass-produced color digital camera under $1,000. Its distinctive, binocular-like form is pure 1990s industrial design." },
            { rank: 15, model: "Epson R-D1", type: "Digital Rangefinder (APS-C)", era: "Digital Revolution (2004)", originalPrice: 2999, currentValue: 2000, synopsis: "The world's first digital rangefinder camera, beating Leica to the punch.
